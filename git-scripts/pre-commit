# Find all Cargo.toml files and run cargo fmt in their directories

# This pre-commit hook script ensures that Rust code is properly formatted
# before committing. It searches for all Cargo.toml files within the repository,
# changes to their respective directories, runs `cargo fmt` to format the code,
# stages any changes made by `cargo fmt`, and then returns to the root directory.

# Get the root directory of the repository
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Find all directories containing Cargo.toml within the repository
find "$REPO_ROOT" -name Cargo.toml -exec dirname {} \; | while read -r dir; do
    # Change to the directory
    cd "$dir"
    # Run cargo fmt
    cargo fmt
    # Stage any changes made by cargo fmt
    git add .
    # Change back to the root directory
    cd "$REPO_ROOT"
